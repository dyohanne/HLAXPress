- to put code on github
	- I first put the main script  /proj/project_2000416/nanoporeProjects/HLAXpress_AlleleSpecificExpression_refactored.R 
		into a new file in its on directory ... done
	- parsing arguments, updating their comments and removing some, ..done.
	- test Data and hla allele input data prepared,.. done
	- last installation in puhti, ... done
		Make sure you give instructions in the Read me of this github:

	- make changes to the script so that it runs with simple named read samples : done
		- started working on the nanopore data, i think it combined 2D, template and etc reads into one file in this script,
		  i think it is best to ask users to just provide the combined data of all or a single data, then change to fastq here or keep as fastq.gz
		  so since last works with both fastq and fastq.gz files, I can just simply run a combined (2d + template etc).fastq.gz file or similar for illumina file
			- finally decided to accept either 3 files for 2d, template, complement (we combine ourselves) or combined one file of all three.
 
		- test this part, continue tomorrow !! 
			-testing with illumina data with sample names at the beginning, done
			-testing nanopore data, done

		- no need to make it runnable from command line using R script; instead that can be added later when the typing is included or when this
			- done to run from function or from command line, tested both with illumina data, works good.
		 
		- writing method part
			- do next, START HERE

		- For now it is just enough to have the functions in one file, and show how it can be used by calling from another file called testRun.R with example files
			-done
		- So I just need to write a description of the arguments, done
		- write argument documentation in the R functions: done

		- Perhaps, users can pass a pattern for the sample names in the read files, or how to find them ??, but it is better to inforce my rules
			- discarded
		- handle the TSO + primer issue for nanopore reads (get them from user)
			- Do in the future
		- get umi length also from users
			-Done


	- create a git for the script
		- done
	- try to use example data (smaller size) and put on the same directory
		-done
	- push to github
		-done
	- write github ReadMe
		-done



# for illumina read data
Rscript HLAXPress.R testData testData/testDataHLAs --hlaRef totalHLAdb/hladb --readType illumina

# for nanopore data (three separate fastq.gz files in testData ), this is not yet tested, it had some error, check it
# hla allele info of sample47 from illumina used for BC01, for quick testing
